My research spans entomology, morphometry, and insect behavior, with a particular focus on honey bees, though I also study other Hymenoptera and Diptera. A central component of my work is the analysis of insect wing morphology using geometric morphometrics. Through these methods, I investigate patterns of wing variation both within and between species.

In recent years, my research has concentrated on the geographic variation of honey bee populations. The resulting data provide valuable tools for distinguishing among populations from different regions and contribute to understanding the processes shaping honey bee diversity. To facilitate the practical application of these findings, I developed IdentiFly, a software tool that enables beekeepers to differentiate between local and imported honey bees. This work supports biodiversity conservation by helping maintain locally adapted honey bee populations.
